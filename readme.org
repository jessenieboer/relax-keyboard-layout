#+html:<h1 align="center">The Relax Keyboard Layout</h1>

* What
A keyboard layout the Kinesis Advantage2 that's designed to minimize muscle usage.

#+html:<img src="relax.jpg" alt="Relax keyboard layout" title="Relax keyboard layout">

** Features
- The most commonly used letters and punctuation (biased towards programming) are assigned to the easiest-to-reach keys
- Thanks to the Kinesis Advantage2, four different 'layers' allow us to reuse those easiest keys four times
- With a foot pedal, no thumb usage is necessary, allowing us to type from a relaxed hand position
- Common bigrams are arranged either for opposite hands for an easy finger roll on one hand
- F keys are more accessible than on a normal keyboard
- The Kinesis Advantage2 makes it easy to customize the layout

* Why
I have a genetic muscle disease that causes my muscles to become exhausted very easily. I cannot sustain the exertion required for normal computer use, and if I try to push my hands and arms beyond their limits, it gets painful. Since developing and adapting to this keyboard layout, however, I've been able to be more productive without wearing out my muscles to an unhealthy degree.

* For Whom
Myself and anyone else who finds that using the normal QWERTY layout is too strenuous or painful. I think this layout could especially help people with Repetitive Strain Injury from computer use and, while I'm no doctor, I suspect it might help prevent it.

* By Whom
Me, acknowledging:
- Kinesis, for their excellent keyboard: https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage2-keyboard/
- The workman layout, from which I drew some inspiration: https://workmanlayout.org/
- I believe I used this excellent site for data on the most commonly used letters, bigrams, and trigrams in English, but it seems to have disappeared: http://mtgap.bilfo.com/theory-of-letter-frequency.html
- Xah Lee, for this report on punctuation frequency in computer languages: http://xahlee.info/comp/computer_language_char_distribution.html
- This online tool I used to generate the image of the layout: http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/,

* How
** Installation
Requirements:
- Kinesis Advantage 2 and some basic familiarity with how it works
  - manual here: https://kinesis-ergo.com/wp-content/uploads/Adv2-Users-Manual-US_6-22-21.pdf

1. Activate Power User Mode (progm + shift + esc)
   - The led lights on the keyboard will flash four times when Power User Mode is activated, twice when it's deactivated
   - To find out if the keyboard is in Power User Mode, open a text editor and hit progm + esc to print out a status report. If you're in Power User Mode, it will contain the line "Power user mode> on"
2. Open the v-Drive (progm + F1)
3. Navigate to the v-Drive and go into the "active" directory
4. Replace either qwerty.txt or dvorak.txt from this repo, depending on which layout you want to replace 
5. Close v-Drive (progm + F1)
6. Activate either qwerty (progm + F3) or dvorak mode (progm + F4) depending on which layout you replaced in step 4

** Use

** Development
*** how it was made
subjectively figured out which keys are easiest for me to hit
used jetbrains mps to get my head around it and generate layouts. probably overengineered 
*** decisions made
- thumbless seems better
- looked into data for which letters, bigrams, and punct are most common
- strong finger for number layer
- f keys easy to hit bc i use them for modal editing with emacs hydra
*** still to do
have not worked with the number/control layer much so there could be improvements there
  
** Contributing
- customize yourself
